NEVER rewrite full files for the purpose of fixing or migration files! YOU WILL LOSE STUFF. Instead, move components individually into new files, then create a new ENHANCED file of the original file, then once the ENHANCed file has EVERY component from the original file included and enhanced significantly, and DEBUGGED perfectly with database connections etc. THEN, TELL ME TO delete the original file.
